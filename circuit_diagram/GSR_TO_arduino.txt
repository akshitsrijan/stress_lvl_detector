Hi...
Couldn't find an accurate image for the GSR sensor connection so I made a .txt file for listing out the connections.
It is very simple and straightforward.

+5V of GSR----------> +5V of arduino uno
GND of GSR----------> GND of arduino uno
OUT (GSR)-----------> analog pin A0 of arduino uno

Hope this is easy to understand :)
